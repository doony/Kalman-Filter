# Kalman-Filter
Kalman filter simulation built in Processing (java). Visualises a vehicle (say a boat) on a 2D plane, with ABS (e.g. your GPS/GNSS coords read) and REL (accelerometer, gyro) with noise, combined to provide a position estimate similar to how your phone GPS works. It uses a simple state vector of position and velocity in x,y. 
As mentioned in the code I had plenty of help from other sources including 'Mean vector and covariance matrix'  (nist.gov).  'Kalman filter basics' (cmu.edu) and 'student dave' on youtube.
